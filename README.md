# Design and Development

To design my website, I started my creating mockup versions of what my website would look like in mobile, tablet, and desktop view, so that I could figure out how all of my content would display.

I used [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) to create these wireframes.

### Sitemap

After doing mockups, I created a sitemap to outline how my pages would link together.

I used [Lucid Chart](https://www.lucidchart.com/) to create this:

### Building the site

After planning out the process, I began to build the site using HTML and CSS. I initially planned to build a skeleton site using just HTML, then adding the styling components later, however, I found myself getting drawn into the styling more and more, and ended up building the site a little bit backwards.

I struggled to keep things clean while building, and realised how easy it is to over-complicate small tasks, which made it very difficult to make the site responsive.

I now realise that I should have started by building the site in mobile view, and them upscaling, rather than the other way around.

Upon reflection, I will definitely take the lessons I have learned while building this site, to create a cleaner version that functions exacly how I would like it to.

## Target Audience

This website is designed to showcase me as a developer to potential employers.

This site allows them to see everything they need to know in one space. It shows my abilities, past projects, and future goals.

I have used icons and images to make the website more user friendly. This way, I have managed to avoid big chunks of text that are tedious and monotonous to read, as employers don't want to read essays about every potential candidate.

I tried to make my site stand out by using animations and making each webpage simple, yet colorful, while incorpotating simple effects such as :hover.
